Hi <%= @profile.first_name %>,

Thank you for signing to up to volunteer with
VirginiaFIRST. You've selected to support the following
<%= "event".pluralize(@profile.volunteer_events.count) %>:

<% @profile.volunteer_events.sorted.each do |event| %>
  <%= event.name %>
  <%= event.venue %>
  <%= event.street %>
  <%= "#{event.city}, #{event.state} #{event.zip}" %>

<% end %>
Don't forget to update your calendar! You'll be contacted by a volunteer
coordinator during the weeks leading up to an event who will provide you
with more information about your volunteer assignment, along with additional
logistic details and training materials if necessary.

We understand that plans change and if you can't attend an event you can
either let your volunteer coordinator know when they introduce themselves to
you. Or you can sign back into the VirginiaFIRST Volunteer website and update
which events you want to attend from your account page.
